# Machine Learning Algorithms
A personal machine learning library in Python
Anything involving deep learning is over at https://github.com/rohan-varma/neuralnets. 

Algorithms with linear decision boundaries (perceptrons, logistic regression, linear regression) are in the linear_algorithms folder, algorithms with non-linear decision boundaries (k-nearest neighbors, decision trees) are at the nonlinear_algorithms directory. 

Currently Implemented:

- Basic sampling from distributions and plotting them on matplotlib
- Perceptron algorithm
- Voting perceptron 
- K-Fold Cross validation to detect overfitting
- Hyperparameter tuning with K-Fold CV, and other stuff 
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression

Todo: 
- Support for feature transformations
- SVMs
- Decision Trees
- Kernel functions
- Multiclass logistic regression
- Multiclass SVMs 
- k nearest neighbors
- ridge regression
- lasso regression
- kernelized regression
- kernelized nearest neighbors
- kernelized SVM
