# Machine Learning Algorithms
A personal library of machine learning & data visualization algorithms made to enhance my understanding of the algorithms, implement them in practice, and see how well they do on toy datasets. 

Anything involving deep learning is over at https://github.com/rohan-varma/neuralnets. 

Algorithms with linear decision boundaries (perceptrons, logistic regression, linear regression) are in the linear_algorithms folder, algorithms with non-linear decision boundaries (k-nearest neighbors, decision trees) are at the nonlinear_algorithms directory. 

Currently Implemented:

- Basic sampling from distributions and plotting them on matplotlib
- Perceptron algorithm
- Voting perceptron 
- Decision Tree on Titanic Dataset
- K-Fold Cross validation to detect overfitting
- Hyperparameter tuning with K-Fold CV
