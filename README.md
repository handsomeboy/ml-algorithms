# Machine Learning Algorithms
Just a personal library of machine learning & data visualization algorithms made to enhance my understanding of the algorithms, implement them in practice, and see how well they do on toy datasets. 

Currently Implemented:

- Basic sampling from distributions and plotting them on matplotlib
- Perceptron algorithm
- Voting perceptron
